# Open questions

{: .no_toc }

Everything waiting on Griff: work that is not built, choices Claude made that he has not seen, and
things the app does that may not be what he meant.

Nothing here is settled. Anything settled lives in [Decisions](decisions.md).

## Why this file exists

Claude wrote most of the old decision log, and for months wrote it in Griff's voice — entries marked
"Griff's ruling" on questions he had never been asked. Those entries were then quoted back to him in
later sessions as constraints he had set. On 12 September 2026 that nearly stopped a feature he had
just asked for. On 20 September 2026 the log was retired for a second reason: entries in it described
behaviour the build no longer had, including a privacy property the code did not hold. It is
[archived](archive/decisions-2026.md) and may not be cited.

[Decisions](decisions.md) starts again from what is true today and marks every entry **RULED**,
**PROPOSED** or **FACT**. This file is the other half: everything **PROPOSED** that is worth his
attention, written as a question rather than a statement.

## Waiting on an answer

Griff worked through the rest on 2026-09-13, and three more on 2026-09-15. Those rulings were
recorded in the log that is now [archived](archive/decisions-2026.md); the links below go there, and
what they describe has not been re-checked against the build.

Closed on 2026-09-15: the six-character phrase (ruled — ten characters *and* a commitment, see
[Decisions](archive/decisions-2026.md#the-verification-phrase-gets-ten-characters-and-a-commitment)); *Notify
anyway* (answered out of Apple's own documentation rather than by asking Apple, see
[Decisions](archive/decisions-2026.md#the-app-does-not-set-an-interruption-level-because-it-is-a-messaging-app));
and forcing the emoji keyboard, deleted at Griff's instruction because the approach was abandoned —
the searchable grid that replaced it is ordinary SwiftUI and needs no device to test.

### What a transient notice is, on iOS 26

Answered from Apple's guidance and ruled on 2026-09-15. Apple's [Alerts](https://developer.apple.com/design/human-interface-guidelines/alerts)
page says to avoid an alert that only informs and to "prefer finding an alternative way to communicate
it within the relevant context". So a message deleted by consensus leaves a permanent line in the
transcript where it was, not a notice that fades. Griff: "Yeah, I'm good with the permanent inline."
See [Decisions](archive/decisions-2026.md#a-deletion-leaves-a-line-in-the-transcript-not-a-notice-that-fades). It
applies when consensus deletion is built, which is [after TestFlight](after-testflight.md).

### Raised and answered 2026-09-16

Seven questions came out of working the ticket list; Griff answered all of them the same evening.

1. **The camera ask** — the shape stands. The setting is off until camera access has actually been
   allowed, then saved on; *Not now* stops the asking; the setting lives in Behavior.
2. **The notification explainer** — one button, and the no is given to Apple. It already had one
   button; it can no longer be swiped away.
3. **The accent retint** — keep the fade, with the tab bar leading.
   [Decisions](archive/decisions-2026.md#the-accent-retint-fades-and-the-tab-bar-leads-it).
4. **"A fingerprint changed"** — cannot happen here, because an identity is its keys; somebody who
   starts over is a new person who has to be invited again. Replaced by a dated notice when somebody
   you talk to **adds a device** the ordinary way. Restores already have their own notice.
5. **The comparison sheet** — once per person, the first time a conversation with them opens after
   joining, skipped if you have already compared.
6. **One identity per account, offline** — wait until iCloud can be checked.
   [Decisions](archive/decisions-2026.md#a-first-launch-that-cannot-reach-icloud-waits).
7. **A disabled button's label** — keep Apple's look; the record is corrected.
   [Decisions](archive/decisions-2026.md#a-disabled-button-keeps-the-systems-look).

## Choices Claude made that Griff has not seen

Each of these was marked **PROPOSED** in the [archived log](archive/decisions-2026.md). They are defaults, not
constraints, and any of them may be wrong for reasons only Griff has.

**Sync and the log**

- How a round is packed, what a packet carries, and when it is acknowledged.
- A room announces what happened to it, in its own transcript.
- A key handed over carries the way back, or it hands over nothing.
- Somebody who stays turns the key after somebody leaves.
- A tag the app keeps is derived, never filed.
- A purge is a tombstone, and the link survives it.

**Invitations and rooms**

- An invite travels as a link, and the link changes nothing about the invite.
- An invitation's lifetime bounds the offer up to the confirmation, and the room is not where it is
  asked.
- A confirmation answers one invitation, not one person.
- A conversation with one person is a solo, founded as one.

**Outposts**

- Access to a wall is a set of periods, and only one change is one-way.
- A comment belongs to the wall it lands on.
- A bell for a post is asked for by the reader, and the asking travels.
- A wall carries its own picture pointer, at the wall's own address.

**Identity and people**

- What you call somebody is yours, and so is the face you give them.
- Which picture is drawn for somebody, in one place.
- A shared photo is a standing attachment, not a log entry.

**Recent, 2026-09-17**

- Deleting a conversation reaches every device, waits for the leaving, and leaves photos for others.
- The notification extension writes nothing to the container it shares with the app.
- A color is measured on every ground it is drawn on, in both appearances.
- The source is published under the Mozilla Public License 2.0.
- The free Supporter year starts the first time an App Store build opens, the claim rides the member's
  preferences, TestFlight is detected through `AppTransaction`, and the badge travels as its own
  entry.
- The Classic drawing is offered in white on every accent too, beside the Antenna and Mailbox
  drawings Griff asked for.

**Honesty and interface**

- A failure the member could act on is reported to the member.
- A spinner is a claim, and it has to stop when the work does.
- Silence is a claim, and usually the wrong one.
- A wait must be able to end by itself.
- A seen mark is the first receipt that covered it.
- An accessibility floor is measured against what is actually behind the thing.
- Search is a tab at the trailing end, and the inline field is for sub-views.

## Design commentary

Long-form design reasoning, kept because it is useful when picking a feature back up and separated
because it is not a decision and must not be cited as one. The boards themselves, the rulings they
carry and the departures already agreed are in [Design](design.md).

### Where the app was changed away from a board without Griff seeing it

**The list row names no sender.** Ruled on 2026-09-13: the board is overruled and Messages' row
stands. See [Decisions](archive/decisions-2026.md#the-rooms-list-row-is-messages-and-board-53-is-overruled) for
what that costs.

**Search became a tab.** The first attempt was an inline field with
`.searchToolbarBehavior(.minimize)`, chosen for the collapsed glass magnifier. On a 402pt phone that
crams the clear and the dismiss into one capsule while a 440pt phone separates them — the same build,
two devices. Apple's guidance turns on the scope of the search: a search covering a whole app is a
tab, and the inline field under a title is for a search scoped to one section. Griff caught the first
answer and quoted the page.

**The notification defaults were Claude's and are now ruled.** New posts default to *By Outpost* —
only the walls a member has turned on. Replies on posts you commented on and comments on your posts
are on; replies on posts you *reacted to* and likes are off, and likes are the only kind that arrives
quietly. Confirmed 2026-09-13: the two that are on are somebody answering you, and the two that are
off are a tap and a thread you touched once.

### What the set does not settle, and neither does the app

**Nothing has been checked on a device at a real Dynamic Type size.** The boards are HTML
approximations drawn at 1:1, and the app's own accessibility pass covers targets, Dynamic Type and
contrast, and on 2026-09-16 every screen was walked at the largest type size on a simulator. A
phone at that size has not been looked at, and the VoiceOver walk waits for TestFlight on Griff's
ruling of 2026-09-17. A photo's reactions pill is not named in that pass and may not have been
looked at the largest size.

**Two platforms are undrawn, and the claim has changed rather than the app.** Ruled 2026-09-13: the
product is an iPhone app until TestFlight. The Mac window keeps working because Griff uses it; it is
not offered or described. Every Mac and iPad decision in it is still Claude's.

**Light mode is not drawn.** Two boards define the values and four use them. Every color the app
picks for itself was measured in both appearances on 2026-09-17, so light mode is measured rather than
inferred, but it was never designed screen by screen.

**Transitions are not drawn.** Sheets, tab switches and navigation use the system's motion. The one
motion the app adds, the accent retint, was recorded frame by frame and kept on Griff's ruling of
2026-09-16.

### Things tried and abandoned, so they are not tried again

**Swipe-to-remove, twice.** A swipe action is as wide as its content and the row slides by that much,
so on a person row whose name is one short word the swipe pushed the row off its own leading edge. It
left a member being asked to remove somebody whose name and face had scrolled out of view. A context
menu replaced it and is better: it draws the row as its own preview, so the person stays on screen
under the destructive verb.

**`.submitLabel(.send)` on the composer.** It renames the return key, takes the newline away, and
still does not submit — measured, then reverted. The arrow in the field sends; ↵ writes a second
line.

**The search glyph taking the app's accent.** `.tint()` does not reach `searchable()`, and
`UISearchBar.appearance().tintColor` does not reach iOS 26's collapsed search button. Both were tried
on device. The toolbar's menu glyph is drawn in the primary ink to match it instead.

## Not built

[The roadmap](roadmap.md) is the status of record. This is the short form, 2026-09-17.

**Every iPhone ticket is built to its status**, and what is left on most of them is proof — a rig
run that has not happened, a phone, or something outside the app existing. The one ticket marked
Incomplete is *Before TestFlight*, a checklist rather than a feature.

**Four tickets marked complete carried unmet criteria**, found reading the epics on 2026-09-17, and
all four are closed the same day: *Recovery from a lost device* (two were already ruled, two were one
sentence on the stalled screen), *Blocking a person* (*Block and Leave*), *Reactions on messages*
(one spoken sentence for a post's row, a *React* action on a message) and *A test seam that cannot
lie* (the fake screen, and the extension writing over the app's state file).

**The Supporter purchase is not built.** The TestFlight build grants a free year and shows the badge;
the App Store build has nothing to buy yet. It needs two auto-renewable subscriptions in one group in
App Store Connect — $12 a year, $1 a month — and a sign-up screen that meets Apple's list: the name,
the period, the price, and a way to restore.

**Decided against for now:** consensus hard delete and hard delete with a quiet desync (pushed out,
with the machinery both need now built), and an in-app lock (canceled). Reasons on
[After TestFlight](after-testflight.md).

**Desktop.** Its own [roadmap](roadmap.md#the-desktop), sequenced after TestFlight.
